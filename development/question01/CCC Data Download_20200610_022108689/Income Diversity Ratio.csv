"Name","Income Diversity Ratio"
"Description","The income diversity ratio is a&nbsp;single value meant to represent the variability in the distribution of income in a geography. In this instance CCC uses an 80:20 ratio, which compares income at the 80th percentile (the upper limit of the fourth quintile) with income at the 20th percentile (the upper limit of the bottom quintile).<br />
<br />
For example, a neighborhood where the 80th percentile earner makes $100,000 annually and the 20th percentile earner makes $20,000 would report an income diversity ratio of 5.0. The lower the ratio, the more equal the income distribution,&nbsp;and vice versa."

"Notes","A greater income diversity ratio does not necessarily equate to higher or lower incomes in a community overall. For further context, check out data on&nbsp;<a href=""https://data.cccnewyork.org/data/map/66/median-incomes#66/39/3/107/40/a/a"" target=""_blank"">Median Incomes</a>&nbsp;for a snapshot of average household incomes (or, income at the 50th percentile) across the city.<br />
<br />
Additionally, the ratio for the 80th-to-20th percentiles of income distribution is just one of a variety of ways to measure income inequality. Research underscores the importance of considering more than one metric of inequality (e.g. the Gini Coefficient, Theil index, Palma Ratio, and other distribution ratios). However, some findings suggest that income inequality in New York City does not vary as much as other metropolitan areas when comparing across different metrics of inequality.
