"Name","Poverty by Race/Ethnicity"
"Description","Individuals living in households with incomes below the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) by racial/ethnic groups.&nbsp;Racial/ethnic groups are defined as follows: White = non-Latino White alone, Black = non-Latino Black alone, Asian = non-Latino Asian or Pacific Islander alone, Latino = Latino of any race.&nbsp;"
"Source Notes","U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates, Public Use Microdata Sample File (2007-2018); retrieved from <a href=""https://data.census.gov/"">https://data.census.gov/</a>."
"Notes","The Federal Poverty Level (FPL) is an income threshold calculated by the U.S. Census Bureau each year for the purpose of estimating the number of individuals and households living in poverty. The income threshold varies based on the number of children and adults in a household and the age of the head of household. In 2018, the FPL for a household consisting of two adults and two children was $25,100. The Census Bureau excludes institutionalized individuals, individuals living in military group quarters or college dorms, and unrelated individuals under 15 years of age from poverty estimates.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Poverty data displayed in Race/Ethnicity breakdown may differ slightly from poverty data displayed in Total breakdown because data in Race/Ethnicity breakdown were derived from Census Public Use Microdata files, while data in Total breakdown were derived from Census summary table files. (See sources.)&nbsp;Percents refer to the percent of the population of the selected racial/ethnic group for whom poverty status was determined.&nbsp;"
